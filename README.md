## Motivation
Learn how to use maps and points in the maps in React, and make my life easier during the pandemic

## Build Status
Everything done minus the phone and tablet view.
Need to add another table for tests done.
## API reference
I used 'https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all' for fetching the world wide data.
I used 'https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries' for fetching the data by country.
